# ConVista-CPI-Helper-Chrome-Extension
This Chrome Plugin extends the SAP Cloud Platform Integration with some useful features. It includes a button to activate traces and a message sidebar directly in the Integration-Flow-Designer.
As SAP is not well known for it's usability it was time to integrate some features ourselves.

## Special Thanks
Many thanks to ConVista Consulting AG in Cologne, Germany. They supported this idea from the beginning and contributed time and ressources for me to start this project. Also many thanks to open this project to the public under GNU GPLv3. I hope there will be many more people to contribute in the future.

## Installation
You need Google Chrome to install this plugin. I tested it with version 80. I assume that older versions will work too.
There are two options to install this plugin:
### Install directly from Chrome Web Store (recommended)
Just add the plugin in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/convista-sap-cpi-helper/eaddejljhdjeddibkomjfonojmcegkna).
This is probably the easiest way. 
### Install in developer mode from sources
If you know what you are doing, you can install the plugin directly from sources.
Clone the repo and add the folder directly to Google Chrome
>- Download or clone the repo from github. Unpack if necessary.
>- In Google Chrome, Navigate to Settings â€“ > Extensions
>- Enable Developer Mode (slider on the top-right)
>- Click: "Load Unpacked Extension" and select the folder with the plugin data

## Update
Please replace the folder with the new version on your disk. After that you must delete and add the plugin in Chrome Browser.
If you have cloned the repository, pull new data. Than delete and add the plugin in Chrome. Restart Chrome.

## Usage
### New Buttons
If you open an Integration Flow, the plugin will automatically add a "Messages", a "Trace" and a "Info" button in the Integration-Flow-Designer. 
#### Message Button
The "Message" button opens a small dragable sidebar with the last processed messages. You can jump directly to infos and traces of the message run. If you hover messages with error, you will see the error message directly.

## Todos
### New features:

- Add possibility to show errors, payloads, properties and headers from messages directly in the design screen

### Things to improve:
- Find a better way to get the X-CSRF-Token. Currently there is a background javascript for that.
- Find a better way to detect url changes
- Improve design
